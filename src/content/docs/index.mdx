The Invsy SDK provides a predictable and intuitive interface for interacting with the [Invsy API](https://api.invsy.com/ui). This guide will instruct you through setting up Invsy, creating and storing a chat.

<br />

<Steps>

    1. ## Installation
        Install the SDK with npm, pnpm, yarn..
        <Tabs>

            <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
                ```sh
                npm add invsy
                ```
            </TabItem>

            <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
                ```sh
                pnpm add invsy
                ```
            </TabItem>

            <TabItem label="Yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
                ```sh
                yarn add invsy
                ```
            </TabItem>

        </Tabs>
        <br />
        <br />

    2. ## Create client
        To begin, import the [Invsy class](/invsy-client). You can create a reusable client by defining a const/function that takes environment variables as input and returns a new instance of the Invsy class. This approach encapsulates the client logic and makes it easy to reuse across your application.

        Check out the guides on using [environment variables](/guides) for different frameworks.

        ```ts
        import { Invsy } from 'invsy'

        export const invsy = new Invsy(
          'INVSY_API_KEY',
          'INVSY_PROJECT_ID',
          'USER_ID'
        );
        ```
        <br />
        <br />

    3. ## Create a chat
        To [create a chat](/chats/create), you can use the `create` method. This method takes optional chat meta as input and returns a promise that resolves to the created chat object.

        ```ts
        const chat = await invsy.create({
          title: 'My first chat'
        });
        ```
        <br />
        <br />

    4. ## Save the chat
        To [save the chat](/chats/save), you can use the `save` method. This method takes a chat object as input and returns a promise that resolves to the stored chat object.
        ```ts
        const messages = [
          {
            content: 'Hello, world!'
          }
        ]
        // Update meta title, use the first message as the chat title
        const title = chat.messages[0].content.substring(0, 100);

        const chat = await invsy.save({
          meta: {
            title
          },
          messages
        });
        ```
        <br />

    5. ## Get a chat
        To [get a chat](/chats/get), you can use the `get` method. This method takes a chat ID as input and returns a promise that resolves to the chat object.

        ```ts
        const chat = await invsy.get(chat.id);
        ```
