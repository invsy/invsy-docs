The Invsy SDK provides a predictable and intuitive interface for interacting with the [Invsy API](https://api.invsy.com/ui). This guide will instruct you through setting up Invsy, creating and storing a chat.

<Steps>

    1. ## Installation
        Install the SDK with npm, pnpm, yarn..
        <Tabs>

            <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
                ```shell
                npm add invsy
                ```
            </TabItem>

            <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
                ```shell
                pnpm add invsy
                ```
            </TabItem>

            <TabItem label="Yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
                ```shell
                yarn add invsy
                ```
            </TabItem>

        </Tabs>
        <br />
        <br />

    2. ## Create client
        To begin, import the [Invsy class](/invsy-client). You can create a reusable client by defining a const/function that takes environment variables as input and returns a new instance of the Invsy class. This approach encapsulates the client logic and makes it easy to reuse across your application.

        Check out the guides on using [environment variables](/guides) for different frameworks.

        <Code code={snippetsCoreInvsyClient} lang="ts" />

    3. ## Create a chat
        To [create a chat](/chats/create), you can use the `create` method. This method takes optional chat meta as input and returns a promise that resolves to the created chat object.

        <Code code={snippetsCoreCreateChat} lang="ts" />

    4. ## Save the chat
        To [save the chat](/chats/save), you can use the `save` method. This method takes a chat object as input and returns a promise that resolves to the stored chat object.
        <Code code={snippetsCoreSaveChat} lang="ts" />

    5. ## Get a chat
        To [get a chat](/chats/get), you can use the `get` method. This method takes a chat ID as input and returns a promise that resolves to the chat object.

        <Code code={snippetsCoreGetChat} lang="ts" />
</Steps>
